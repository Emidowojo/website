Sometime in June, one evening while at the gym carrying weights, I decided to take a break, drink some water, and scroll through my phone when I saw a new email.  
Lo and behold, it was a congratulatory email from the Linux Foundation Mentoring Team letting me know that I had been accepted as an [LFX mentee](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) for the Inspektor Gadget team. I was **stunned**. Grateful, overwhelmed, but stunned — because just a few months prior, I had never even heard of the LFX mentorship program.

## Why I Joined

Earlier this year, in a bid to gain mastery in my chosen field as a Technical Writer, I decided to go all-in on my DevOps career. I enrolled in a very intense program called HNG, which provided rigorous training and hands-on experience across various tech fields. It spanned from January to April and was one of the most challenging experiences I had ever had.  

After graduating, I wanted to build more projects, learn more, and document my journey. That’s when I stumbled upon the LFX mentorship portal. Honestly, the projects all looked like technical gibberish to me at first, and I doubted whether I had the right experience in DevOps or cloud to apply. Still, I threw my hat in. The worst that could happen was a rejection.  

I narrowed my options to three projects (Cilium, Antrea, and Kgateway) and began drafting applications. But on one last review, I stumbled upon **Inspektor Gadget** — and three things immediately stood out:  
1. I’m quirky, so seeing a “k” instead of a “c” in the name tickled me.  
2. I vaguely remembered watching *Inspector Gadget* as a child, which intrigued me.  
3. Most importantly, the mentor was a woman. That representation mattered deeply to me.  

So I dropped Cilium (networking never clicked for me) and went all-in on Inspektor Gadget.  

## My Work & Contributions

My mentorship focused on increasing the traction of [Traceloop](https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/main/gadgets/traceloop/), one of the gadgets in the Inspektor Gadget ecosystem. Traceloop is a container observability tool powered by [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) that abstracts away complexity so users can quickly trace issues in their applications without diving into kernel internals.  

I had never heard of eBPF before, so I threw myself into research and prepared as best I could. To this day, I’m not sure why I was selected — but I’m glad my mentor Maya took a chance on me.  

Over the course of the mentorship, my work followed a [four-phase journey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FaVBag2vz2fM0tsSXLLx0A8uiq8uLuF6O7DnxbqJEPE/edit?gid=594956095#gid=594956095):  

- **Onboarding**: Learning the ins and outs of Traceloop, running [user research](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/issues/4657), and competitor analysis.  
- **Mid-program**: Drafting a [go-to-market (GTM) strategy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uIO8BUjyztLl-Vcr9CDTsSaEGgF5yKF6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115111942975009205543&rtpof=true&sd=true), creating content and community plans, and testing ideas.  
- **Deeper execution**: Refining the GTM approach, building developer content (tutorials, [a CNCF webinar](https://youtu.be/cR1yFRlMD7U?si=_Omd0xIXnQL6qHaw)), overhauling [Traceloop’s documentation](https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/main/gadgets/traceloop/), and even running [adoption experiments](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HrOQ9P4aHuwdDCqsrLMvznSfQoVUVYkm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115111942975009205543&rtpof=true&sd=true).  
- **Final stretch**: Packaging everything into a complete [adoption toolkit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vt1o1I68g5ZLkOV_y5kLKl0wJmrKe9KXuWefPI3XnNc/edit?usp=sharing), polishing docs, and delivering a full handoff.  

At first, I leaned too much on technical details instead of focusing on user experience. Maya constantly reminded me to **lead with empathy** — framing everything around user needs instead of just features. That shift reshaped not just my work, but my entire perspective on product marketing and DevRel.  

## What I Learned

As Steve Jobs once said, *“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.”* Looking back, this mentorship was exactly the pivot I needed to move toward DevRel and product marketing.  

On the **technical side**, I:  
- Deepened my understanding of eBPF and Kubernetes internals.  
- Gained hands-on experience building and documenting frameworks others depend on.  
- Used the [docs-as-code](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/1c74f89/what_exactly_is_the_docsascode_process/) approach for the first time, and learned how to build [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) sites (something I’d always wanted to try).  

On the **non-technical side**, I:  
- Learned to communicate complex systems with empathy.  
- Practiced user-focused storytelling instead of technical overload.  
- Collaborated asynchronously across time zones in an open-source setting.  
- Grew through mentorship and teamwork, boosting my confidence in contributing to open source.  

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

One of my biggest challenges was trying to grasp eBPF deeply enough to explain it clearly. I often got caught up in technical details and struggled to simplify them for users.  

On top of that, I was nervous about conducting user interviews and hosting the CNCF webinar. I worried about saying the wrong thing or failing to connect with the audience.  

Through mentorship, I learned to prepare thoroughly, focus on empathy, and trust the process. What once felt overwhelming became turning points that helped me grow in confidence and connect more authentically with users.  

## Impact

The mentorship had measurable impact on Traceloop and me personally.  

- **Docs clarity**: Users who found the docs easy to implement rose from 31.6% → 45.5%.  
- **Understanding**: Users who understood Traceloop rose from 20% → 63.6%.  
- **Reach**: Our CNCF webinar drew nearly 700 viewers, amplifying visibility.  
- **Ecosystem**: Simplified onboarding lowered barriers for contributors, strengthening the community.  

For me, seeing these results was incredibly validating — proof that communication, when done empathetically, can drive adoption and impact at scale.  

## Moving Forward

Although the program is ending, I plan to keep contributing to Traceloop: updating docs, gathering feedback, and sharing it in developer communities. I want to see awareness grow into deeper adoption.  

Personally, this experience has confirmed my path in **Product Marketing, Developer Relations, and Open Source**. It taught me the value of empathetic, problem-focused communication — skills I want to keep refining so that users not only discover tools but truly trust and benefit from them.  

## Closing

I am deeply grateful to everyone who made this journey possible.  

- To my mentor **Maya** — thank you for believing in me, guiding me with patience, and reminding me always to put users first.  
- To the engineers **Alban, Mauricio, Qasim, Francis, Slava, Jose, and Burak** — thank you for reviewing my [PRs](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pull/4776), answering endless questions, and making the experience less intimidating.  
- To the **Linux Foundation** — thank you for creating the LFX mentorship program.  

And to anyone thinking about applying: **Do it. It’s a life-changing opportunity.**
